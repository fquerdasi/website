abstract: Caregiving adversity (CA) exposure is robustly linked to increased risk for poor oral, physical, and mental health outcomes. Increasingly, the gut microbiome has garnered interest as a contributor to risk for and resilience to such health outcomes in CA-exposed individuals. Though often overlooked, the oral microbiome of CA-exposed individuals may be just as important a contributor to health outcomes as the gut microbiome. Indeed, outside the context of CA, the oral microbiome is well-documented as a regulator of both oral and systemic health, and preliminary data suggest its association with mental health. However, research examining the association between CA and the oral microbiome is extremely sparse, especially in childhood, when the community composition of such organisms is still stabilizing. To address that sparsity, in the current study, we examined composition and differential abundance metrics of the oral microbiome in 152 youth aged 6–16 years, who had either been exposed to significant caregiving adversity (significant separation from or maltreatment by a caregiver; N = 66, CA) or who had always remained with their biological/birth families (N = 86, Comparison). We identified a significant negative association between hair cortisol and oral microbiome richness in the Comparison group that was significantly blunted in the CA group. Additionally, youth in the CA group had altered oral microbiome composition and elevated abundance of potentially pathogenic bacteria relative to youth in the Comparison group. Questionnaire measures of fatigue, somatic complaints, and internalizing symptoms had limited associations with oral microbiome features that were altered in CA. Although we found differences in the oral microbiomes of CA-exposed youth, further research is required to elucidate the implications of those differences for health and well-being.


# Summary. An optional shortened abstract.
#summary: This study draws on a large longitudinal cohort to demonstrate that adversity experienced prenatally or during early childhood, as well as adversity experienced by the mother during her childhood, impacts the gut microbiome of second-generation children at 2 y old. Notably, some of the microbiome profiles linked to these types of adversity, especially at higher taxonomic levels, were similar to those associated with the child’s current and future socioemotional functioning. Additionally, microbes uniquely associated with adversity exposures or socioemotional functioning have similar immune-related functions within the gut, highlighting the need for further research into how generational adversity affects the gut microbiome’s functional potential.
