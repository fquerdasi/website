abstract: Mental and physical health are closely tied, and a deeper understanding of how the mind, brain, and body are connected has the potential to substantially improve health outcomes. In particular, a translational approach that integrates research on mind–brain–body connections at multiple levels of analysis (e.g., basic science, patient-oriented, and intervention science perspectives) can contribute toward the development, targeting, and implementation of mechanistically informed and effective interventions to improve mental and physical health. The three articles in this special issue elucidate a range of biological and behavioral mechanisms within the mind, brain, and body that contribute to health. The varying levels of analysis examined in each article complement each other to arrive at deeper insights than any one article would alone. Taken together, their research highlights the added value of moving from separate mental and physical health care models toward holistic care, and of considering how context may inform “for whom” a given intervention is most effective.

# Summary. An optional shortened abstract.
summary: Psychological research that examines the mind–brain–body connection at multiple levels of analysis has the potential to improve mental and physical health outcomes if a translational approach is used to integrate their differing perspectives. This introduction illustrates, using the articles in this special issue, how powerful scientific and clinical insights can be gained by synthesizing across research that examines the mind–brain–body connection at multiple levels of analysis. The understanding gained from this integrative, translational approach is applicable to professionals across a range of disciplines, including scientists, clinicians, and policymakers.
