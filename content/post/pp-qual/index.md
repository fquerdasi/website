## Context

This is a memo I wrote as an intern at [Public Profit](https://www.publicprofit.net/). It summarizes insights from a qualitative project that evaluated a Foundation-funded initiative to better support to rural male students, a demographic that often shows particularly poor academic success outcomes. The initiative included foundation funding for a cohort of new programs at 4 community colleges specifically designed to support rural male students. 

The evaluation project's goals were to better understand each program's service model, including the strategies staff used to recruit and retain students, how each program was shaped by their unique institutional and community context, what worked well about the Foundation's supports and what could be improved, and big-picture lessons the initiative could hold for the field. 

Interviews were co-conducted by me and another Public Profit staff member. Analysis and writing were led by me, with feedback from other project staff members. 

Foundation and college names have been redacted to maintain privary.
