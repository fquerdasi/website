## Context

This is a memo I wrote as an intern at [Public Profit](https://www.publicprofit.net/). It summarizes insights from a qualitative project that evaluated a Foundation-funded initiative to better support rural male students, a demographic that often shows particularly poor academic success outcomes. The initiative included foundation funding for a cohort of new programs at 4 community colleges specifically designed to support rural male students. 

The evaluation project's goals were to better understand each program's service model, including the strategies staff used to recruit and retain students, how each program was shaped by their unique institutional and community context, what worked well about the Foundation's supports and what could be improved, and big-picture lessons the initiative could hold for the field. 

Interviews were co-conducted by me and another Public Profit staff member. Analysis and writing were led by me, with feedback from other project staff members. 

Foundation and college names have been redacted to maintain privary. 

# Memo Text:

This memo shares insights from Public Profit’s interviews with 4 [REDACTED] initiative direct service staff members, one from each of the participating colleges, in July 2024. 

## Key Takeaways
* Each program’s service model and staff approaches are tailored to their college’s specific institutional, community, and demographic contexts.
* All programs engaged in some experimentation to achieve the necessary customization for their program. This process took time and included a mix of some ideas that were successful, coupled with some that didn’t turn out as expected and were dropped. * All staff center their work on building and maintaining relationships with the students they serve, high schools where they do outreach, and other campus programs. 

## Recruitment and Retention Strategies

**Staff from all programs focus on building strong, trusting relationships**
All staff members emphasized the importance of building trust and strong relationships with rural male students. Building trust over time is perhaps especially important when working with rural male community college students: several staff shared that it often takes time before students feel comfortable enough to share about more personal topics with program staff, who can then refer them to appropriate services. Staff cultivate relationships by introducing themselves to each student, maintaining an approachable presence, practicing active listening, and communicating that they are there to help students. 

> *"I make a point of communicating that it’s about them being successful, not about me helping them. It’s finding those little pieces that make them know that I see them and care about them, I’m not just going through the motions.”* – Staff at [REDACTED] Community College

> *“My recommendation [to someone else setting up a similar program] would be to build the relationships as quickly as you can. Relationships in the high schools, and of course, with your students.”* - Staff at [REDACTED] Community College 

> *“I think building relationships starts with honesty, introducing yourself to the student and making sure that they understand you’re 100% here for them.”* - Staff at [REDACTED] Community College 

> *“Part of building trust is just listening. I think most students really need someone to listen.”* - Staff at [REDACTED] Community College

**Staff from all programs prioritize consistent communication and/or visibility**
While staff vary in how assertive their communication is, all prioritize consistent check-ins with students and/or consistent visibility of their services on campus. Several staff put a lot of effort into reaching out persistently to students who are struggling to help them address the issues they are experiencing. Maintaining a consistent in-person presence in places students spend time was also important for several staff: one attends students’ classes to provide academic support, another establishes relationships with students through their role as a sports coach, and a third advertises their events by spending time in the common areas of campus where students hang out. One staff has formalized regular visibility of services by sending newsletters to students.
