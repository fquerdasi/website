I am a research scientist currently pursuing my PhD at the University of California, Los Angeles (UCLA). I am passionate about using my research skills to improve health, well-being, and DEI.

At UCLA, I study how stress, adversity and social relationships shape health outcomes. I combine advanced statistical modeling, machine learning, and bioinformatics to derive insights from complex clinical, social, and biological data. I secured over $130k in funding for my research by winning 8 competitive fellowships/grant awards. 

I fell in love with research at Pomona College, where I wrote my undergraduate honors thesis on cognitive strategies fathers can use to be responsive parents, even in challenging conditions. During my junior year I became fascinated by the ways that experiences of childhood adversity could shape the brain and body for years to come, casting long shadows that stick around into adulthood. That led me to Stanford University, where I studied how experiences during pregnancy and early infancy shape childrenâ€™s brain and emotional development before starting my PhD.
